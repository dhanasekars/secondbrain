# Projections

### scalar projection is $r.s/|r|$

A ball travels with velocity given by $\begin{bmatrix}2\\1\end{bmatrix}$ with wind blowing in the direction given by $\begin{bmatrix}3\\-4\end{bmatrix}$ with respect to some co-ordinate axes.

What is the size of the velocity of the ball in the direction of the wind?
Answer
$\begin{bmatrix}2\\5\end{bmatrix}$

This is the scalar projection of the velocity of the ball onto the velocity of the wind.

### vector projection is $(r.s/|r|^2)r$

Example is velocity 
  
Question 1

In this assessment, you will be tested on all of the different topics you have in covered this module. Good luck!

A ship travels with velocity given by $\begin{bmatrix}1\\2\end{bmatrix}$ , with current flowing in the direction given by $\begin{bmatrix}1\\1\end{bmatrix}$ with respect to some co-ordinate axes.

What is the velocity of the ship in the direction of the current?


Answer 
$\begin{bmatrix}3/2\\3/2\end{bmatrix}$


This is the vector projection of the velocity of the ship onto the velocity of the current.
