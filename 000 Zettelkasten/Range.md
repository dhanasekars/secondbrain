# Range

Range is not only used in For loop, it can be used where a sequence of integer is required.

similar to [[Tuples]] but concatenation and repetition is not available. 

comparing range
```py
range(0,17,2) == range(0,18,2)
```
The above will return Trues

The other functions that can be used in iterable in range are [[iterable helper functions]]
