# 1.2 Elements of programming

Programming language is more than instructing computers to perform tasks. 
It's a framework to organise our ideas about computational processes.
A Program must be written for people to read, not only for computers.

``` ad-quote
When we describe a language, we should pay particular attention to the means that the language provides for combining simple ideas to form more complex ideas

```

``` ad-summary
title: Every powerful language has three such mechanism

[primitive expressions and statements - simplest building blocks](obsidian://open?vault=Second%20Brain&file=000%20Zettelkasten%2FStatements%20and%20Expressions%20flowchart)
means of combination - compound elements are built from simpler ones
means of abstraction - compound elements can be named and manipulated as units
```
