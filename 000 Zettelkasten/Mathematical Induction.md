# Mathematical Induction

It is a general way to prove that some statement about the integer $n$ is true for all  $n \geq n_0$. 

First we prove when n has its smallest value, $n_o$ ; this is called  $basis$
Then we prove the statement for $n > n_0$ , assuming that it has already proved for all values between $n_0$  and $n -1$ inclusive.
