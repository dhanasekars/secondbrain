# Functions are first-class objects

means they can be treated like any other objects like string and int
- they can appear in expression (right hand side)
- as an argument to another function
- can be elements of lists
- return a function

Functions as argument is called [[Higher order Programming]] , this is convenient especially in conjunction with list

In python we have [[map]] for HOP.
