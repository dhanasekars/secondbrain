# Functions

Functions are an essential ingredient of all programs, large and small, and serve as our primary medium to express computational processes in a programming language


```ad-warning
title: Without Functions

Our programs would be able to compute squares, but our language would lack the ability to express the concept of squaring.

will force us to always work with primitives in the language.

### Decomposition : 
Break problem into different self contained pieces. Function is one of them, [[Classes]] are another example.

[[functions  as abstractions]]
