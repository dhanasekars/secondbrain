# How to create MOC

This video by [morganeua](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVCaYGoX8UXU7N7v5KdvkiQ) gave an interesting idea to take MOC.
Instead of creating a separate file first, go to your MOC , type your notes, then give a heading as backlink, then open the new notes, cut the content from MOC and paste it <3
