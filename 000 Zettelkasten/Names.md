# Names 

Variables.  Using names to refer to computational objects.

If a value is given to a name, then the name *binds* to the value.

```
Radius = 5

= is the assignment operator.

```ad-quote
title: Abstraction

Assignment is the simplest means of #abstraction.

```

The memory that is used to track names, values and binding to retrieve later is called *environment*.

Names can be bound to functions. Example ```max```
