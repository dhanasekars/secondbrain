# Recurrent problems

First take advantage of generalisation.
Then introduce appropriate notation : NAME AND CONQUER :-) 

For example solving [[Towers of Hanoi]]

Let generalise $T_n$  is the minimum number of moves that will transfer $n$ disks from one peg to another.
Now, 
$T_0  = 0$
$T_1 = 1$
$T_2 = 3$

By experimenting it was figured 

$T_n\leq 2T_(n_-1_)+1$
