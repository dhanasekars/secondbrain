# Two types of function

```ad-note
title: Pure function

Functions have some inputs(arguments) and return some outputs(return value)

```

```ad-tip

Pure function must always return the same value when called twice with the same argument
```

Because pure functions do not have any side effects or change behaviour they are used to create compound call expressions.
We can use max, add to make nested expressions but not non-pure functions like Print.

```ad-note
title: Non-pure function

In addition to returning a value, a non-pure function can generate side effects.
```
