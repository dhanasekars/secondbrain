# modules

Another [[Learnings from modules]]
sometimes you many need to set or operate on the packages or modules, not on the objects. 

Great example from Turtle modules, in order to use RGB value for turtle colour, colour mode needs to be set to module not on the object.

```py
turtle.colormode(255)
```
