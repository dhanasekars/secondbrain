# Object Oriented Programming

Steve jobs explaining [OOP](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/steve-jobs-in-1994-the-rolling-stone-interview-231132/)

Abstractions of both data and function.  Objects model real world objects.

What it has ? - Data --> attribute -->  variable
What it does ? - [[Methods]] --> functions


Constructor is initialisation of objects. 
In python this is done using 

```py
def __init__(self)
```

Use Setters and Getters, to avoid interacting with the internal implementation of the Class. A way to enhance Encapsulation.
