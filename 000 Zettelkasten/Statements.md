# Statements
Statements are not evaluated but executed; they do not produce any value but instead make some changes.


```ad-tip

Expressions are evaluated
Statements are executed



```

Statements can also be evaluated eg
 ```
 >>>def square(x):
	    mul(x,x) <-- notice it is not returning anything
```

Sometimes it does make sense to have function body is an expression
 ```
 >>>def print_square(x):
	    print(square(x))
```

Some simple statements -- That does not end with a colon
- expressions (above example)
- assignment statements
- return

compound statements -- span multiple lines, and start with one-line header ending with a colon.

Conditional statements -- 

Iterations --
