[[Functions]] that manipulates functions are call [[Higher-Order Functions]]

How a function manipulates a function ?

By calling another functions as arguments.
By returning a function as return value.

Why to have higher order function ?

There are common programming pattern that recur in the code, in order to achieve abstractions assigning names for common pattern.

```ad-important

express certain general patterns as named concepts, we need higher-order functions.
