# Session on [[Personal Knowledge Management]]

The idea is to take a session on [[Personal Knowledge Management]]

First talk about PKM
Why?
	1. From [[Think like a Rocket Scientist]]  quote '' Answers are no longer a scarce commodity, and knowledge has never been cheaper. By the time we’ve figured out the facts—by the time Google, Alexa, or Siri can spit out the answer—the world has moved on.

Varol, Ozan. [[Think like a Rocket Scientist]] (p. 24). Ebury Publishing. Kindle Edition.  "

[[latticework of mental models]]

"Yes, our ability to learn isolated facts is indeed limited and probably decreases with age.

That makes it easier not only to" (from "[[How To Take Smart Notes]]: One Simple Technique to Boost Writing, Learning and Thinking – for Students, Academics and Nonfiction Book Writers" by Sönke Ahrens)


Pick from [[Six steps to successful writing]] [[short-term memory]] from [[How To Take Smart Notes]]
