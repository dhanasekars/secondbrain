```ad-abstract
title: Good Function

- Each function should have exacly one job.
- Don't Repeat Yourself 
- Should be defined generally.

```

Should be defined generally - There is no square function because it can achieved by more generic function called 'pow'

## Function documentation

^0fca16

Use [[docstring]] ^d93b58

- First lune describe job of a function in one line.
- Following lines can describe arguments and elaborate describing the function.
- Try to have default arguments wherever possible. 

Most data value using the function's body should come from named arguments exception of any constants. 
Constants can be bound in the function body or global frame.
