# Trial and error

``````
Evolutions works by trial and error, not by planning
``````

Planning restricts, closing options restrict you. This leads to work controling us. When you have more options to complte the work, you tend to enjoy and you feel you are controling the work rather than work controling you. 

The ability to control our worl and change course is necesary. More control we have to steer our work towards what we consider as interesting and relavent, the less willpowee we have to pit. Only then can work itself become the source of motivation.
