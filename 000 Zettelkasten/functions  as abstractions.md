# functions as abstractions

We never worry about or required to understand how is function is implemented in order to use it. As long as one knows the below three aspects of the function

**Aspects of functional abstraction.**

domain of a function - the set of arguments it can take.
range of a function - set of values it can return
intent of a function - relationship it computes between input and output ( also any side effects [[Two types of function#^5f19a2]] 

The above does not specify how the intent is carried out, that detail is abstracted 

```ad-quote
title: Abstraction hides details

Preserving information that is relevant in the context and forgetting information irrelavant to the context.
