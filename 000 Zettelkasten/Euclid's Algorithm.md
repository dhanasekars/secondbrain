# Euclid's Algorithm

This is used to compute gcd using [[Mathematical Induction]]  and thus apply [[Recursive function]]

This is based on the [[Euclidean division]]

>The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the greatest common divisor of two numbers does not change if the larger number is replaced by its difference with the smaller number.

This has many theoretical and practical applications.

- Part of cryptographic protocols
- factoring largest composite numbers
- to find accurate rational approximations
- can be used as basic tools for proving theorems in [[number theory]]
