# Learnings from gcd program

## Mistakes
There were a few logical flaws. 
- Didn't think about dividing by both a and b.
- While base condition was wrong, should have been > 0 but I used >= 1
- [[My common programming mistakes#^d05dd5]] did this as well.

## Learning

- Effective use of debugging tool. For time used effectively to check the loop, and that's where most of the above mentioned flaws were uncovered.
