[[Mathematics MOC]]
[[Statistics]]  is a central component of data science because statistics studies how to make robust conclusions based on incomplete information. 

[[Computational Thinking MOC]] 
Computing is a central component because programming allows us to apply analysis techniques to the large and diverse data sets that arise in real-world applications: not just numbers, but text, images, videos, and sensor readings
