title: Rocket Scientist Thinking

- Look at the world through different lens.
- Imagine the unimaginable, Solve the unsolvable.
- Transform constrains into advantages.
- Moved not by blind conviction but by self-doubts.
- Goal is never short-term results but long-term breakthroughs.
- they know 
	- rules arent set in stone.
	- defaults can be altered
	- a new path can be forged.
