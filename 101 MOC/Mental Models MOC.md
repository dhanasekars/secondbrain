#🏡
Capture all mental models that can be applied to take decisions, and used in learning.

The mental models are classified to design-patterns and anti-patterns based on the book [[Super Thinking]]

### Design pattern:

These are kind of best practises that can be applied. [[Architect Christopher Alexander]] introduced the concept of Design Pattern

[[is brick an essential object?]] is a mental model I derived from the Feynman questioning. 

### Anti-pattern :

The opposite of the well-tested design is the anti-pattern. Seemingly intuitive but actually ineffective solution, these are patterns that should be avoided.

Example : Test automation cone - anti-pattern
